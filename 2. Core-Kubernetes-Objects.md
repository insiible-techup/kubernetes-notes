# Core Kubernetes Objects

## 1. Pods in Depth

- Smallest deployable units in Kubernetes
- Represent a single instance of a running process in a cluster
- Can contain one or more containers that share:
  - Network namespace (IP address and port space)
  - Storage (volumes)
  - Specifications on how to run the containers

Key characteristics:
- Ephemeral (not designed to persist)
- Scheduled on nodes
- Have a unique IP address within the cluster
- Can define resource requests and limits

Pod lifecycle:
- Pending → Running → Succeeded/Failed
- Can be in a CrashLoopBackOff state if continuously failing to start

## 2. ReplicaSets and Deployments

### ReplicaSets:

- Ensure a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time
- Provide high availability and load balancing
- Use a pod template to create and manage pods

### Deployments:

- Provide declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets
- Manage the deployment and scaling of applications
- Support rolling updates and rollbacks
- Typically used instead of directly creating ReplicaSets

Key features of Deployments:
- Scaling (manual or automatic)
- Rolling updates with customizable strategies
- Rollback to previous versions
- Pause and resume capabilities

## 3. Services and Networking Basics

### Services:

- Abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods
- Provide a stable IP address and DNS name for a set of pods
- Enable load balancing across pods

Types of Services:
- ClusterIP: Exposes the service on an internal IP (default)
- NodePort: Exposes the service on each Node's IP at a static port
- LoadBalancer: Exposes the service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer
- ExternalName: Maps the service to a DNS name

Networking basics:
- Each Pod gets its own IP address
- Services route traffic to Pods using label selectors
- Ingress resources can provide HTTP routing

## 4. ConfigMaps and Secrets

### ConfigMaps:

- Store non-confidential configuration data in key-value pairs
- Can be used to set environment variables, command-line arguments, or config files in a volume
- Decouple configuration from pod specifications

Usage:
- As environment variables
- As command-line arguments
- As configuration files in a volume

### Secrets:

- Store and manage sensitive information (e.g., passwords, tokens, keys)
- Base64 encoded by default (not encrypted)
- Can be mounted as files or exposed as environment variables

Types of Secrets:
- Generic: Created from files, directories, or literal values
- TLS: Created for TLS certificates
- Docker-registry: Created for Docker registry authentication

Best practices:
- Use RBAC to control access to Secrets
- Consider using external secret management systems for enhanced security
- Rotate Secrets regularly

These core objects form the foundation of Kubernetes applications, allowing for flexible, scalable, and manageable containerized deployments.
