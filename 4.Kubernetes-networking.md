# Kubernetes Networking

## Service Types

### ClusterIP (default)

**Purpose:** Exposes the service on an internal IP address within the cluster

**Access:** Only accessible within the cluster

**Use Case:** Internal communication between services

**Example:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: MyApp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```

### NodePort

**Purpose:** Exposes the service on each Node's IP at a static port

**Access:** Accessible from outside the cluster by requesting `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`

**Use Case:** Simple external access to a service, primarily for development or testing

**Example:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: MyApp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
      nodePort: 30007
```

### LoadBalancer

**Purpose:** Exposes the service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer

**Access:** Accessible via an external IP address provided by the cloud provider

**Use Case:** Production environments requiring a stable external IP and load balancing

**Example:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: MyApp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```

## Ingress and Ingress Controllers

### Ingress

**Purpose:** Manages external access to services, typically HTTP/HTTPS

**Features:** Provides load balancing, SSL termination, and name-based virtual hosting

**Components:**
- **Ingress Resource:** Defines the routing rules
- **Ingress Controller:** Implements the rules defined in the Ingress Resource

**Ingress Resource Example:**

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
spec:
  rules:
    - host: myapp.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: my-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```

### Ingress Controllers

**Purpose:** Implement the Ingress rules and manage the actual routing

**Popular Ingress Controllers:**
- NGINX Ingress Controller
- Traefik
- HAProxy
- Istio

**Example of Deploying NGINX Ingress Controller:**

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/main/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
```

## Network Policies

**Purpose:**
- Control the communication between pods within the cluster
- Define rules for ingress and egress traffic
- Enhance security by restricting access to specific pods

**Key Concepts:**
- **Namespace:** Network policies are namespace-scoped
- **Selectors:** Use label selectors to specify the pods to which the policy applies
- **Policy Types:** Ingress, Egress, or both

**Example Network Policy:**

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-nginx
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: frontend
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
  egress:
  - to:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: backend
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080
```

## Best Practices

- Start with a default deny-all policy and explicitly allow required traffic
- Use namespaces to isolate different environments (e.g., dev, staging, production)
- Regularly review and update network policies to adapt to changing requirements

These notes cover the essential aspects of Kubernetes networking, including different service types, ingress management, and network policies. This foundational knowledge will help you design and manage network configurations in Kubernetes effectively.
