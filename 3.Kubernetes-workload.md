# Kubernetes Workloads

## 1. Deploying Stateless Applications

Stateless applications don't store persistent data and are easier to scale and manage in Kubernetes.

Key points:
- Typically deployed using Deployments
- Can be easily scaled horizontally
- No need for persistent storage
- Examples: web servers, API gateways

Deployment process:
- Create a Deployment YAML file
- Define container image, replicas, and other specifications
- Apply the Deployment using `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`
- Kubernetes creates ReplicaSet and Pods based on the specification

## 2. Managing Application Updates and Rollbacks

Kubernetes provides mechanisms for updating applications and rolling back if issues occur.

Update strategies:
- **Rolling Update (default)**:

  - Gradually replaces old Pods with new ones
  - Configurable via `maxUnavailable` and `maxSurge` parameters
- **Recreate**:
  - Terminates all existing Pods before creating new ones
  - Results in downtime but ensures a clean slate

Rollback process:
- Use `kubectl rollout history` to view revision history
- Use `kubectl rollout undo` to revert to the previous version
- Can specify a particular revision to roll back to

Best practices:
- Use readiness probes to ensure new Pods are ready before receiving traffic
- Implement proper health checks
- Use canary deployments for critical updates

## 3. DaemonSets and StatefulSets

### DaemonSets:

- Ensure that all (or some) nodes run a copy of a Pod
- Useful for cluster-wide services like logging, monitoring, or storage daemons
- Automatically adds Pods to new nodes as they're added to the cluster

Use cases:
- Node monitoring daemons
- Log collection daemons
- Storage daemons (e.g., Glusterd, Ceph)

### StatefulSets:

- Manage stateful applications that require stable network identities and persistent storage
- Provide guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of Pods
- Each Pod gets a persistent identifier that it maintains across any rescheduling

Key features:
- Stable, unique network identifiers
- Stable, persistent storage
- Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling
- Ordered, automated rolling updates

Use cases:
- Databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- Distributed key-value stores (e.g., Cassandra, Elasticsearch)

## 4. Cron Jobs and Jobs

### Jobs:

- Create one or more Pods and ensure they successfully terminate
- Can run Pods in parallel
- Useful for batch processes, one-time computations, or any task that should run to completion

Key features:
- Can specify the number of successful completions required
- Can set a time limit for job execution
- Automatically clean up finished Jobs (configurable)

### Cron Jobs:

- Create Jobs on a repeating schedule
- Based on Cron format from Unix-like operating systems
- Useful for scheduled backups, report generation, or any recurring task

Key points:
- Specify schedule using Cron syntax
- Can set concurrency policy (Allow, Forbid, or Replace)
- Can set starting deadline and history limits

Best practices:
- Set appropriate resource requests and limits
- Use appropriate retry and backoff mechanisms for failed Jobs
- Monitor Job completion and handle failures appropriately

These workload resources provide flexible ways to deploy and manage various types of applications in Kubernetes, from simple stateless services to complex stateful applications and scheduled tasks.
