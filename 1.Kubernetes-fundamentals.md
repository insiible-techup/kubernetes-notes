# Kubernetes Fundamentals

## What is Kubernetes?

- Open-source container orchestration platform
- Automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications
- Originally developed by Google, now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation
- Provides a portable, extensible platform for managing containerized workloads

## Kubernetes Architecture

### Control Plane Components:

- **API Server**: Exposes the Kubernetes API, acts as the front-end for the Kubernetes control plane
- **etcd**: Consistent and highly-available key-value store used for all cluster data
- **Scheduler**: Assigns nodes to newly created pods
- **Controller Manager**: Runs controller processes (e.g. node controller, replication controller)
- **Cloud Controller Manager**: Interacts with the underlying cloud provider's API

### Node Components:

- **Kubelet**: Agent that runs on each node, ensures containers are running in a pod
- **Kube-proxy**: Network proxy that maintains network rules on nodes
- **Container Runtime**: Software responsible for running containers (e.g. Docker, containerd)

## Key Kubernetes Concepts

### Pods:

- Smallest deployable units in Kubernetes
- Can contain one or more containers
- Share network namespace and storage
- Ephemeral - can be created, destroyed, and replaced dynamically

### Nodes:

- Physical or virtual machines that run Kubernetes workloads
- Each node runs the kubelet agent and container runtime
- Can be worker nodes (run application workloads) or control plane nodes

### Clusters:

- Set of nodes that run containerized applications managed by Kubernetes
- Consists of at least one control plane and multiple worker nodes
- Provides high availability and scalability for applications

### Additional key concepts:

- **Deployments**: Manage the desired state of pods and ReplicaSets
- **Services**: Abstract way to expose applications running on pods
- **Namespaces**: Virtual clusters for resource isolation within a physical cluster
- **ConfigMaps and Secrets**: Mechanisms to decouple configuration from pod specifications
